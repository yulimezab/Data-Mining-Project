# ðŸ“Š Data Mining Project

## Project Overview
This project is divided into multiple deliveries, each focusing on different aspects of data mining, from data selection and exploration to migration, modeling, and dashboard presentation.

---

## Delivery 1: Data Selection  
**Due Date: 16/08/2024**

- **Justification**  
  Explain why you chose this particular dataset.

- **Relevance**  
  Describe how the chosen dataset aligns with the project goals and the type of data available. Provide references to similar use cases or studies where this type of dataset has been employed.

## Delivery 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Due Date: 13/09/2024**

- **Data Overview**  
  Summarize the dataset, including the number of observations, variables, and data types.

- **Exogenous Repositories**  
  Identify and describe any external data sources that can be integrated to enhance the analysis. Explain the relevance and potential impact of this additional data.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Create visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. Use graphs, charts, and plots to illustrate your findings.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Detail the process of cleaning the data, including handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Document any transformations or normalizations applied.

- **Data Imputation**  
  Explain the methods used for imputing missing values and justify the choice of techniques.

## Delivery 3: Data Migration to BigQuery  
**Due Date: 18/10/2024**

- **Migration Plan**  
  Outline the steps for migrating the data to BigQuery, including data preparation, schema design, and loading strategies.

- **Execution**  
  Describe the execution of the migration process, including any challenges encountered and how they were resolved.

- **Models**  
  Any database/data warehouse model you may think is reasonable to present.

- **Model Preparation**  
  - **Model Selection:** Choose a model and prepare it for training.
  - **Training:** Describe the training process, including the data split strategy (training, validation, testing), hyperparameter tuning, and the computational resources used.
  - **Cross Validation:** Explain the cross-validation method applied and the rationale behind choosing it. Present the results and discuss their implications.
  - **Metrics and Results Analysis:** Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics. Provide a detailed analysis of the results, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other relevant metrics. Discuss any discrepancies or insights gained.

## Delivery 4: Dashboard Presentation  
**Due Date: 15/11/2024**

- **Dashboard Design**  
  Describe the design and layout of the dashboard. Explain the choice of visual elements and how they contribute to an intuitive and informative user experience.

- **Implementation**  
  Detail the tools and technologies used to create the dashboard. Include any integration with BigQuery or other data sources.

- **Presentation of Results**  
  Use the dashboard to present the final results of your project. Highlight key findings, trends, and actionable insights derived from the analysis.

- **User Interaction**  
  Explain how users can interact with the dashboard, including filtering, sorting, and drilling down into the data. Provide examples of different user scenarios.

## Final Presentation  
**(Last day of classes)**

- **Overview**  
  Summarize the entire project, including the problem statement, methodology, key findings, and conclusions.

- **Feedback Incorporation**  
  Discuss how feedback from each homework was incorporated into the final project.

- **Future Work**  
  Suggest possible extensions or improvements for the project. Identify any limitations and propose solutions for future iterations.
