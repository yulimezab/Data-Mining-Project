## Delivery 1: Data Selection  
**Due Date: 16/08/2024**

### Dataset Chosen
The dataset selected for this project is the **"Flight Price Prediction"** dataset, which includes **300,261 datapoints** and **11 features**. The data was scraped from the **"Ease My Trip"** website, covering flight bookings between India's top 6 metro cities over a 50-day period in early 2022.

### Justification

#### üìà Comprehensive Data
The dataset contains a substantial number of observations (**300,261**), providing a rich source of information for training robust models. The large sample size ensures that the insights derived from the analysis are statistically significant and generalizable.

#### üéØ Relevance to Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to analyze factors influencing flight ticket prices and predict prices based on these factors. The dataset includes key features such as airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, ticket class, and days left until departure. These features are directly aligned with the research questions we aim to address, making this dataset ideal for the project.

#### üîÑ Categorical and Continuous Variables
The dataset offers a mix of categorical and continuous variables, allowing for diverse analyses. This variety supports the application of different statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, which is planned for this study.

#### üåê Real-World Applicability
The dataset is derived from a real-world booking platform, making the findings and predictions highly applicable to actual scenarios faced by passengers and airlines. The insights gained could inform pricing strategies, help passengers make more informed booking decisions, and contribute to academic research on dynamic pricing models in the airline industry.

### Relevance

The **"Flight Price Prediction"** dataset aligns closely with the project goals, which involve analyzing and predicting flight prices based on several factors. The type of data available (categorical and continuous) is well-suited for answering the research questions, such as:

- **Price Variation by Airline**: The dataset includes the "Airline" feature, which allows for an analysis of how different airlines price their tickets under various conditions.
  
- **Impact of Booking Time**: The "Days Left" feature provides the necessary data to explore how booking closer to the departure date affects ticket prices.
  
- **Effect of Departure and Arrival Times**: The "Departure Time" and "Arrival Time" features enable an examination of how flight schedules influence pricing.
  
- **Class-Based Price Differences**: The "Class" feature allows for a direct comparison between the pricing of economy and business class tickets.

### References to Similar Use Cases

- **üìä Dynamic Pricing Studies**: Similar datasets have been used in studies exploring dynamic pricing models, where factors like booking time, demand, and competition among airlines influence ticket prices.

- **‚úàÔ∏è Airline Pricing Strategies**: Research on airline pricing strategies often utilizes datasets with features similar to those in this dataset to develop models that predict price fluctuations and optimize revenue management.
